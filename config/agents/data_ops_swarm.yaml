# NEXUS DataOps Swarm
# Handles data lineage audits, synthetic data generation, and regulatory
# compliance checks for datasets and AI pipelines.
#
# Typical trigger scenarios:
#   - New dataset ingested → trace lineage + check compliance
#   - Privacy audit required → generate synthetic replacement
#   - Upcoming regulatory deadline → run compliance checklist
#   - Data quality issue detected → profile + validate
#
# Workflow:
#   data_agent: load and profile the target dataset
#   ml_pipeline_agent (optional): run quality checks / feature stats
#   bias_auditor_agent: check for demographic bias in data
#   critic_agent: validate findings
#   writer_agent: produce data governance report
