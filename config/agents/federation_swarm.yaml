# NEXUS Federation Swarm
# Handles Agent-to-Agent (A2A) multi-system collaboration:
#   - Discovery of remote A2A-compatible agents
#   - Task delegation to external NEXUS nodes or compatible agents
#     (Vertex AI Agent Engine, LangGraph Cloud, ADK-based agents, etc.)
#   - Result merging from broadcast delegations
#   - Planner decomposes complex multi-system tasks before delegating
#
# Requires: A2A_AGENT_URLS and/or A2A_API_KEY environment variables
