# NEXUS Maintenance Swarm
# Handles background system health operations:
#   - Memory consolidation (episodic → semantic distillation)
#   - Temporal decay and pruning
#   - Meta-pattern reflection
#   - Knowledge base health reporting
#
# Typically triggered by SchedulerTrigger on a cron schedule
# (e.g., every night at 2 AM local time).
# Always runs PRIVATE privacy tier — never sends memory to cloud.
